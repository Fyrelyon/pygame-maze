Welcome to the Pokemon Maze!

	To begin, press SPACE on the keyboard. This will begin the game.
This game is very simple to play, only involving the arrow keys for gameplay.
	Press the UP arrow key to go Up.
	Press the RIGHT arrow key to go Right.
	Press the DOWN arrow key to go Down.
	Press the LEFT arrow key to go Left.
To win the game, you must collect all 8 coins, which are golden in color and spread across the map.
There are enemies around the map, usually protecting coins. They are purple and will disappear and reappear from time to time.
	You can safely move through them while they are invisible, but if you attempt to move through them while they are fully or very visible you will lose the game.
The timer, if it reaches 0, will cause the game to result in a Game Over.
	Coins add slight additional time, which can help increase your chance of winning.
	The timer will flash when time becomes too low.
